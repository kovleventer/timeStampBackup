# Timestamp Backup LibreOffice Extension

This extension for LibreOffice and OpenOffice enables the 
user to make a normal save and to additionally create a timestamped backup copy of the 
document with just one click.

The backup copy will be placed into the 
backup directory set in `Tools - Options - Open/LibreOffice - Paths - Backups`

It is recommended to adjust the path of the backup directory to a user 
friendly place.

The extension has a menu item in the `File` menu, and a toolbar icon 
in the `standard` toolbar.

It works in these applications: Writer, WriterWeb, WriterMaster, Calc, Draw, Impress, Math.

You can download the latest version of this extension for LibreOffice 
and for OpenOffice from this page:
